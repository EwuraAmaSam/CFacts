C-Facts is a web scraper program meant to provide people with reliable information about climate change. Web Scraping is the process of taking data and content from the internet to be manipulated and analyzed as needed (Hiller). Our solution is an adaptation to climate change. This program works by generating an article at random that seeks to educate the user with credible information about climate change. The articleâ€™s title would first be displayed to the user. If the user chooses to read that article, they confirm it and then the article is opened in the browser. Should the user not be interested in the generated article, they can ask for a new one until they get one that they are interested in. To make the program more interactive, a simple game is included in the program. The game asks the user simple questions on climate change. Based on their score, they are told how familiar they are with the concept of climate change.
